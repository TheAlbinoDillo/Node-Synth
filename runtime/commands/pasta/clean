There are times when ..... I forget I’m a cat... how does one be a cat?

I wash myself everyday..... but then stop..... am I even clean?

Does my tongue make me clean? How does the tongue work?

Perhaps I am truly unclean.... it’s possible..... and yet I wash myself anyway.

How long have I been sitting here, how long..... WHAT IS TIME?
