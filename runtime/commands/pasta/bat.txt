Echo echo echo echolocation
I find my prey I find my way echolocation
Iâ€™m a little brown bat hungry for a midnight snack

Whoop whoop
The sound waves blast I release to find food fast
Bionic ears ultrasonic frequencies I can hear

Whoop whoop
I sleep all day upside down in my cave

Whoop whoop
I fly by night, don't need light, eat meals in flight.

Echo Echo Echo Echolocation
I find my prey I find my way echolocation

Whoop whoop
A squeal, like that hits an insect bounces back

Whoop whoop
Sound reflections will determine my direction

Echo echo echo echolocation
I find my prey I find my way echolocation

Echo echo echo echolocation
I find my prey I find my way echolocation
