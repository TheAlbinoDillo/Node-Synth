Each person is different, so take more frequent and longer breaks if you feel discomfort. If your eyes become tired or sore while playing, or if you feel dizzy or nauseated, stop and rest for several hours before. If you continue to have any of the above symptoms, stop playing and see a doctor. WARNING - Repetitive Motion Injuries Playing video games can make your muscles, joints or skin hurt.
